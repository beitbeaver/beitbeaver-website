New students who have been assigned accommodation in Woodward have been chosen because they are the ugliest among the new intake of freshers, leaked computer code reveals.

The highly-secretive source code for the algorithm used by Imperial Accommodation to assign incoming freshers to accommodation was sent to the Beit Beaver by an anonymous source. Analysis by The Beit Beaver uncovered what are likely to be controversial metrics used to decide where students will live in their first year at Imperial.

The passport-style photos submitted by each incoming student are assessed by an AI-based facial recognition engine, which attaches an ugliness rating to each person. Those scoring the highest are immediately assigned to Woodward Buildings, which received [a nomination for the 2015 Carbuncle Cup](https://www.getwestlondon.co.uk/news/west-london-news/walkie-talkie-wins-carbuncle-cup-9974663), awarded the the UK's ugliest new building each year.

The Beit Beaver's investigation also found that the algorithm guarantees that all communal kitchens are assigned at least two people who are judged to be likely to be wholly domestically incompetent. Such people have been placed in kitchens in order to pose a nuisance to their fellow kitchen users by being dirty, untidy and unhygienic. Unconfirmed reports from those working around the Imperial Accommodation team suggest that measures are taken to ensure that no communal kitchens ever exceed the standard required for a one-star Food Hygiene Rating.

A spokesperson from Imperial Accommodation told the Beit Beaver, "we cannot comment on specifics, but we strive to allocate each individual student the accmmodation arrangement that is the most appropriate to them. We use a variety of criteria and metrics to do this."
