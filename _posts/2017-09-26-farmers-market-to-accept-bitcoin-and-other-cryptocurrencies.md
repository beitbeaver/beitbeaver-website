The popular South Kensington Farmers’ Market, hosted on the Queen’s Lawn every Tuesday, will begin to accept Bitcoin and several other major currencies from late autumn 2017. The market, which also runs on Saturdays on Bute Street, includes dozens of stalls selling fresh produce and food of cuisines from around the world. Currently, all stalls only accept payment in cash, a practice consistent with other streets markets in the UK.

Its popularity as a lunch option for Imperial staff and students on Tuesdays causes long queues to build up at cash machines on campus, as they withdraw cash to take advantage of the market during their lunch breaks. Many staff and students do not carry cash, but instead, like other Londoners, rely on debit and credit cards.

“We want to position ourselves as the best and most customer-friendly market in London, and that calls for constant innovation,” an official told the Beaver.

“The natural progression would have been introducing contactless-enabled card readers or Yoyo Wallet scanners. We have instead gone one step further, and we’re rolling out cryptocurrency payment systems across all our stalls.”

The Beit Beaver understands that 70% of stalls at the South Kensington Farmers’ Market will have systems in place to accept major cryptocurrencies by the end of November 2017, with the remaining stalls accepting them early in the new year. Prices in cryptocurrency will be adjusted in real-time to be comparable to prices in pounds, with payments only being acknowledged after a certain number of confirmations depending on the currency.

*Cryptocurrencies to be accepted:*

- *Bitcoin (6 confirmations, roughly 10 minutes)*
- *Ethereum (30 confirmations, roughly 15 minutes)*
- *Ripple (0 confirmations, since no one actually uses this)*
- *Litecoin*
- *Dash*

Bitcoin Cash will not be accepted.
