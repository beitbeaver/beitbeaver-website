Following the controversial news that SCR breakfasts will no longer be served as reported by Felix, Imperial College today announced heavily revised opening hours for all on-campus toilets in its continuing desperate bid to cut costs.

All on-campus toilets will no longer be available before 10am or after 5pm, with almost half closing at the earlier time of 4pm. Toilets in halls and the Union Building are for the moment, not affected by this change, which will come into effect on 2nd October, coinciding with the new academic year.

As well as shorter opening hours, there are also changes to how they will work on Sundays and bank holidays. “Customers” wishing to make use of the facilities will have to pay a fee on these days. These will be £1 for home and, for now, EU students, £3 for other international students and £30 for staff. The College has made the assurance that the EU students in the new 2017/18 cohort will not be affected by Brexit. New turnstiles will be installed which only accept the new £1 coin, and no other coins.

The Beit Beaver has been informed by anonymous sources that toilets were chosen because “for the past couple of years, toilets have been operating at an annual loss”. The cost of keeping toilets running is not known.

We contacted inside sources for a comment, who said, “we aim to provide the best possible service and experience for our staff and student community, through everything from catering outlets and hospitality services, to sports facilities, student accommodation, the Student Hub, and Early Years provision.”

We then asked specifically about the new hours and charges for toilets and the many implications they would have, and in response to this specific question they replied, “we aim to provide the best possible service and experience for our staff and student community, through everything from catering outlets and hospitality services, to sports facilities, student accommodation, the Student Hub, and Early Years provision.”
