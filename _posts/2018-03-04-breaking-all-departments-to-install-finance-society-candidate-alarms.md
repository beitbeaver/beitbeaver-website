Departments across Imperial are to install alarms on the entrances to all labs and study spaces, connected to Finance Society election candidate detectors.

In light of complaints from students from multiple departments, staff from all departments, as well as Central Library, have agreed to install specialist alarms over this weekend. The move is intended to resolve complaints about Finance Society candidates entering restricted spaces to canvass for votes while they are working.

One student who spoke to the Beit Beaver on the condition of anonymity, said, "I was on my laptop, minding my own business browsing Facebook to avoid the coursework tab which I had open to fell less guilty! Suddenly, I was approached by two people from Finance Soc, and they asked me to vote for them. Can people not procrastinate in peace anymore?"

The new alarms will be triggered when any Finance Society election candidates or members of their campaign team walk past. The systems will also immediately send an email alert to the Deputy Returning Officer.
