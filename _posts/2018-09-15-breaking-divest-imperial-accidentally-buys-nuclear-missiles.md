The student protest movement, Divest Imperial, has purchased intercontinental ballistic nuclear missiles in an apparent administrative error.

The group, which campaigns against Imperial College investing in companies which "damage the environment", inadvertently purchased the missiles after clicking on the wrong supplier on eActivites. An unnamed committee member was generating a Purchase Order for yet another batch of paint for their custom banners, and mis-clicked on BAE Systems.

The British weapons manufacturer interpreted the strange order as a secret coded message from intelligence services, requesting nuclear weapons. BAE Systems shipped the missiles to the Union, where reception staff became suspicious at the large size of the package, which could not fit into the lift, as well as the fact that it had radioactive hazard stickers and faintly glowed green.

A spokesperson for Divest Imperial told the Beit Beaver, "Obviously, this situation is not ideal for us. A genuine mistake was made on our part, and given the amount of environmental damage these products could cause, keeping hold of the nuclear missiles would not align with our values. We are therefore returning the goods to BAE Systems under their 28-day money back guarantee".
