In jubilant scenes at an emergency press conference in the Sir Alexander Fleming building, the Department of Biological Studies announced that for the first time in living memory, an Imperial Biology graduate has found a job.

Kate Choudhury, from a leafy suburb just outside Birmingham, successfully completed five rounds of technical and non-techincal interviews to receive an internship offer for an adult colouring book tester role. The 12-month employment offer is believed to be in the region of £12,000-£15,000, with the potential for a full-time employment offer at the end of the internship, based on performance.

An elated Choudhury told the Beit Beaver, "I'm absolutely overjoyed! Imperial students keep mocking Biology students and their employment prospects, but I've proven that you can achieve anything if you put your mind to it!" She expects to make use of several transferable skills which she has learned as part of her degree program, including colouring-in, through extensive illustration of food cycles, and operating large books. Kate has already made use of her rough understanding of Microsoft Word 2007, which was used to write up her CV.
