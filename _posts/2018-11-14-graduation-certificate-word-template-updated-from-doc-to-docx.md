Imperial College has updated the template used to produce graduating students' degree certificates. The new template uses the .docx file format, an upgrade from the previous .doc file.

The upgrade, its first in over ten years since Imperial College left the University of London, will include no visual changes. This means that next year's graduating students will receive certificates that look identical to those of their predecessors of the past ten years.

Vice Provost (Values), Prof. David Nelson, told the Beit Beaver, "this change cements our position as one of the world's leading research and educational institutions. This upgrade harnesses new state-of-the-art technology to place us at the forefront of all areas of operation."

The change moves the template file from the pre-2003 Microsoft Word format to the one the software has used since its 2007 release. It is thought that this has been done to guard against the possibility of Microsoft removing Compatability Mode from its Office suite.

It is part of a series of upgrades to Imperial College London's operations, which includes the installation of air conditioning in Central Library. Air conditioning is a new and very exclusive technology that has recently been invented over the past two-to-three years. It is not yet available to consumers and can only be found in a handful of buildings in the whole of Europe, making its addition to Central Library all the more impressive.
