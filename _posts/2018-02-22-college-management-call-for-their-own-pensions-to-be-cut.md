title: College management call for their own pensions to be cut

A leaked memo seen by the Beit Beaver has revealed that some of College’s most senior managerial staff have demanded cuts to their own pensions.

In emails between several members of the upper echelons of Imperial College London’s leadership, staff expressed a strong desire to reduce the income they are set to receive in retirement. A spokesperson for Imperial College confirmed that the leaked emails were in fact genuine, and said, “the general sentiment of our senior management staff is very much that they would like to see their pensions reduced.”

> "We need to increase our insecurity about the future since workers who have less certainty about retirement will work harder now."

Imperial College’s Vice Provost (Values), Prof. David Nelson, told the Beit Beaver, “we need to increase our insecurity about the future since workers who have less certainty about retirement will work harder now.” Prof. Nelson continued, saying that it is “absolutely essential that these changes are made in order to improve the management of Imperial College.”

One of his colleagues, who wished to remain anonymous, agreed, and told the Beit Beaver that “there is a really big problem with morale at the moment and nothing would be more beneficial for raising it than cutting our pensions. A huge boost to staff morale would be increasing the university’s operating surplus.” They also suggested that lower pensions would encourage staff to work longer into old age, as, they claim, someone who is 85 or 90 years old would do just as well in a 50 to 60-hour-per-week job as someone who is much younger.

Other top-tier UK universities, including UCL, Southampton and Birmingham, have also raised concerns and joined some of Imperial’s leadership team in calling for senior staff pensions to be cut. The Beit Beaver understands that senior university management staff up and down the country are strongly considering strike action if negotiations stall.
