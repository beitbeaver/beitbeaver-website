Memeperial has been approached by the British government about the use of its platform to host a so-called People's Vote on leaving the European Union.

Officials from the Department for Exiting the European Union were impressed at the *Imperial's Best Boi* format's speed, engagement and resilience against cheating. The fact that votes are made by reacting to Facebook posts guarantees that each person can only vote once. It also allows people the ability to change their vote right up until the deadline. The knockout-tournament format is also advantageous to the current situation - people can effectively rank their preference of the options available: soft Brexit, hard Brexit, no Brexit or no deal.

Critics of a second referendum, a so-called People's Vote, on Britain leaving the European Union, had initially cited the fact that a conventional referendum would have taken 24 weeks to organise. This includes a regulated 10-week campaigning period. Such a long period of uncertainty would have severe adverse consequences on the still-ongoing Brexit negotiations, as well as on financial markets.

Memeperial will be awarded Â£140 million for the contract to implement the referendum. Paul Belushis, CEO of Memeperial, told the Beit Beaver, "This is fantastic news for us and for the Imperial community! It's fantastic that the government have realised that Memeperial's Best Boi competition is a great electoral system which cannot be hijacked by bots, Russians or Russian bots."
