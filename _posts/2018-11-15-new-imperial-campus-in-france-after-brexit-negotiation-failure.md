Following the near completion of the new White City campus, Imperial College plans to further expand its empire to maintain connections with the European Union after Brexit negotiations took a turn for the worst this morning.

The new Toulouse-based campus will allow the university to receive direct funding from the European Union, while maintaining a Â£9250 annual tuition fee for EU students. College board members described it as "a better deal for everyone, but mostly for the college".

Plans for the new venture include more student accommodation, on-campus shisha bars and an Elon Musk-esque Hyperloop shuttle service to transport students to and from the South Kensington campus. The Hyperloop alone is estimated to generate over 400 new final-year projects during the period of its construction, mostly for students studying engineering subjects.

While most college staff and students welcome the move, some have expressed doubt as to whether or not the decision is necessary. "I don't understand how Imperial can have all this money", one student remarked, "and yet instead of spending it on expanding Ethos or lowering fees for international students, they decide to expand their assets by constructing a new campus in France." We wanted to ask further questions but we were informed the student was in a rush to get to his bursary-funded kayak session in the college-subsidised Ethos pool facilities.
