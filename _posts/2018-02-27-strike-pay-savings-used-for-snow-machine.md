title: Strike pay savings used for snow machine

Imperial College have spent money they have saved through salaries forfeited by striking staff on a giant snow machine.

Described by left-wing student critics as a cheap ploy to make students forget about the worsened future financial prospects of their lecturers and their families, a large snow-generating machine was installed at an undisclosed location, high up on Imperial’s South Kensington campus. This caused snow to fall across the campus on Tuesday afternoon.

Vice Provost (Values), Prof. David Nelson, told the Beit Beaver, “this creative initiative has been implemented to improve student welfare by making them slightly happier for a bit.” Many students took advantage of the snowfall by creating snowmen and having snowball fights.

Some, however, appeared not to have not taken the “bait”. An image sent in to the Beit Beaver by one reader (as shown at the top of this article; Photo credit: Owen Heaney) shows what looks like a phallic object, drawn in the snow in front of the Faculty Building, where Imperial College management offices are located.

An anonymous source told the Beit Beaver that this was the work on a militant left-wing extremist faction of the Union Council. The Beit Beaver is unable to verify the authenticity of these claims.
