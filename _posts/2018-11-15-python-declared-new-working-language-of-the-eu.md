The European Union has announced the first in a string of post-Brexit changes: the day-to-day affairs of the organisation will use the Python language.

Python, an almost universally-known language among the elite educated classes, will serve as the main lingua franca among elected officials and so-called Eurocrats, replacing English and, to a lesser extent, French. It is believed that choosing a working language that is not the official language in any of the EU's member states has been done to send a political message: that all countries in the EU will be treated equally and that none will be afforded any special treatment.

The founder of one of the most influential Brexit-supporting social media outlets, [Brexit FIRST](https://www.facebook.com/WEWANTBREXIT/), told the Beit Beaver in response to this news, "MORE ANTI BRITISH SENTIMENT FROM THE EU..... TYPICAL.... WE THE PEOPLE VOTED OUT SO WHY AREN'T WE OUT .... SHARE IF YOU LOVE ARE NHS".

The change is also expected to save the EU a significant amount of money as it removes the need for live translation during sittings of the European Parliament and other meetings.
