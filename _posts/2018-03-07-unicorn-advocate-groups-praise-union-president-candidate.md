The Union President candidate, Dmitrii Usynin, has been lauded for raising awareness for and empowering fellow endangered unicorns by leading advocacy groups, following his performance in the Union's live so-called debate.

The General Secretary of the National Association for the Advancement of Unicorns (NAAU), Klella Neo, tweeted, "It's fantastic to see a Unicorn breaking through the glass ceiling and becoming a key player in Union politics!", while Lord Unico, founder of the Unicorn Preservation Society (UPS), said, "Young unicorns now have a prominent role-model to look up to and be inspired by."

Usynin, a second-year Computing student, took part in the live stream tonight with two of the other candidates running for President, Michael Edwards and Robert Tomkies. None of the other seven candidates showed up for the event. A poll by the Beit Beaver immediately after the debate ended, showed that voters narrowly preferred unicorn candidates, over those who are human or other species, highlighting the popularity of the endangered minority species and Usynin's apparently strong performance.

Dmitrii's campaign manager and ghostwriter, Constantin, told the Beit Beaver, "This is the general election except Lord Buckethead wins this time!" Usynin's followers and supporters have expressed confidence about his chances in the election, although human candidates remain favourites to win.

Unicorn numbers in southern England have dropped rapidly in the past three decades, with numbers now estimated to be around 120-150. This is thought to be due to declining birth rates and mass emigration, caused by high levels of unemployment since many residents in the south of England hold prejudices against Unicorns, believing that they don't exist. Most unicorns in the UK are employed in the children's entertainment industry. Usynin is the first unicorn in living memory to gain a high level of visibility in politics.
