The full text of the Attorney General's legal advice the government on the Draft Brexit deal has been given to the Beit Beaver by a reliable source.

Theresa May's government had tried to resist publishing the full text of the legal advice provided by Geoffrey Cox, the Attorney General, regarding the Draft Withdrawal Agreement for the UK's departure from the EU. It instead published a summary of the advice, but not the full text itself.

The government was forced to publish the text in full after a vote in the House of Commons today, and said through the Leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom, that it would do so tomorrow. The Beit Beaver has learned that this delay is because ministerial staff are still trying to learn how to upload a PDF after they ran out of space on their Dropbox account.
