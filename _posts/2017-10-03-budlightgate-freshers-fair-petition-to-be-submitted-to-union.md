In the past hour, it has emerged that an illegal and unconstitutional petition was sought during Freshers’ Fair on Tuesday by FiveSixEight enthusiasts. Described as an unfair and short-sighted witch-hunt against Union leaders, the group gained 1,612 signatures, calling for the Union to replace the new house lager (Bud Light, as announced on Monday).

The petition asked signatories to vote on the replacement, with a list of three viable alternatives given. The Beit Beaver has seen the results of this poll, and can report that the results were as follows:

- Christian Union free tea with complimentary biscuit (777 votes)
- Bottled spring water from the vending machines (568 votes)
- Tears of Liberal Democrat-supporting students (267 votes)

Since this poll was not conducted using a Single Transferrable Vote (STV) system, it would have been invalid under Union rules regardless.

The organisers of this petition were not available for comment; however, it is understood that several members of the group have submitted memes to the controversial populist platform, Memeperial. The Facebook page has recently come under attack from critics over its enabling of a perceived witch-hunt against the people within the Union behind the unpopular house lager change, now becoming known as BudLightGate. An inside source at Memeperial told the Beit Beaver, “We just post whatever s*** people send in.”
