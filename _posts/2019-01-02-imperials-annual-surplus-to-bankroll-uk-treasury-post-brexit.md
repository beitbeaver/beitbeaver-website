In the British government's latest no-deal contingency plan, the Chancellor has announced plans for Imperial College's annual surplus to be used to all but wipe out the increased budget deficit.

In the wake of the Bank of England's economic forecasts for a no-deal Brexit scenario, the government has been left with the task of finding money to fill in what is predicted to be a Â£39 billion black hole in the public finances. This morning, Chancellor Philip Hammond (at the time of writing) announced that Imperial College has volunteered to donate its annual budget surplus to the Treasury for the next five years, while Britain attempts to strike trade deals with non-EU countries.

Imperial College London is controversially known to make a large profit each year. The university, one of the top 10 globally, profits from sources of income, allegedly including shares in tobacco, arms and oil companies, donations from organisations branded by Felix as "dodgy", graduation tickets and charging high prices for the squash courts in Ethos. It is said that Imperial even makes enough money to sue the Beit Beaver for defamation.

Mr Hammond also revealed that rumours that the NHS will get more money after Brexit are in fact true. However, the money will not come from Britain's EU membership fee, as was suggested by comedy duo, Gove & Johnson, during the referendum campaign, but rather by DoCSoc.
