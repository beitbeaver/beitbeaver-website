The World Health Organisation (WHO) has issued a severe health warning for Fresher’s Flu, a common illness among new students. This year’s outbreak of the pandemic, which occurs every year, has caused widespread disruption, including loud coughing in lectures which has a knock-on impact on the quality of Panopto recordings.

While still in his post before being deposed in an illegal western-backed coup, the WHO’s former Goodwill Ambassador, Robert Mugabe, sent a press statement to the Beit Beaver in a sealed brown envelope. In it, he said, “the sweat-filled air of the hedonistic Metric nightclub is probably the most prominent vector of Fresher’s Flu transmission.” Mr Mugabe also identified the sharing of food on campus as a major catalyst for the illness’ quick spread. The practice has become commonplace since the increase on campus food prices.

Robert Mugabe ended his statement with the words, “We must get rid of [Fresher’s Flu]! Just like we must get rid of white farmers from Zimbabwe!”

Tonight’s Union Council meeting has been postponed due to the Fresher’s Flu health warning from the WHO, controversially, without consulting the student body. An unnamed student commenter, who wishes to remain anonymous, commented to the Beit Beaver, “the hypocrisy displayed by this rash decision is chilling.” The move to postpone the sitting of the Union Council will mean that what will be a contentious debate on BudLightGate will be pushed back a few weeks. Populist critics have accused the Union’s political elite of suppressing dissent about the introduction of the popular spring water brand, Bud Light, in the Union’s bars by using underhand tactics, namely spreading Fresher’s Flu, to cover up the “scandal”.
