Liberal Democrat-supporting students find it more difficult to find a seat in Central Library, a study by a Union Council working group has found.

It also found that this demographic of students were less likely to complain about noisy library users near them, and more likely to vacate their table space when leaving their seat for more than half an hour, as they technically ought to, under the library's rules.

As well as difficulty finding a seat, the study found that Lib Dem students commonly suffer from not being able to re-find their seats their seats after temporarily vacating them. There have been several incidents this year of members of the Liberal Democrat-supporting community sitting on the fence after returning from lunch, mistaking it for their seat.

Several Union Council members have called for the university to improve accessibility for such students. Proposals seen by the Beit Beaver include providing all Lib Dem supporters with "I voted remain" and "Exit from Brexit" t-shirts, so that they can be easily identified by other students so that they can be mocked and then helped.
