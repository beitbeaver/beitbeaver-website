The Head of one of Imperial College’s largest departments has been removed from their post after arriving three seconds late to a meeting about second year seating space, the Beit Beaver has learned. Due to strict EU data protection laws, and also because we’d probably get sued if we did, the Beit Beaver is not permitted to publish their name or identify them.

The College currently has a zero-tolerance policy in all areas of operation, which includes* most notably, student coursework submission. Supporters say that this reflects what happens in the real world, and instills the sort of discipline employers expect from Imperial graduates. A deadline, they say, is a deadline, and it seems that today’s news has proved them right.

Speaking to the Beit Beaver about this decision, the former employee’s Faculty Dean said, “[they have] been an absolutely fantastic member of Imperial’s team for the past 30 years, and have consistently made outstanding contributions to the quality of teaching in their department. They were an excellent Head of Department, who, for the six years they spent in their role, always went well beyond the call of duty; they were always early to meetings. As ever, they were, as the youth term it, on fire, at the meeting, making incredibly wise and insightful contributions.”

“Unfortunately, although it was very out-of-character for them, we cannot tolerate lateness at all. A 10am meeting requires everyone to be in the room at 10am, not 10:00:03am, regardless of when the meeting actually starts. We hope that the actions we’ve taken send out a clear message to all members of staff that arriving even a second late to meetings renders their contributions totally worthless, and not worthy of any credit or notice from colleagues.”

When we asked about the criticism about meetings regularly overrunning, they Dean replied, “what is important is that meeting attendees arrive on time. The fact that meetings do not actually begin until much later on, or the impact on attendees in the event of a meeting overrunning is irrelevant.”

**\* For students, the zero-tolerance policy for coursework submissions has been scrapped since the beginning of the new academic year.**
