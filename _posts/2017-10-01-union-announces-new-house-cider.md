The Union’s Deputy President (Finance & Services), Matt Royal-School-of-Mines-Building earlier today made the surprise announcement that the house cider in the Union’s five bars will be changed to over-diluted Asda Smart Price Apple Squash. This change comes with the promise of a price freeze, just a day after the UK’s Prime Minister, Theresa May, announced a similar price freeze on university tuition fees.

In a post on the Union’s Facebook page this afternoon, Royal-School-of-Mines-Building said, “After 5 years of Somersby, it is only right to update our offering with a fresh look.” It is understood that this change would increase the Union’s profits by at least £10,000 a year, which was one of the promises made in his election manifesto earlier this year.

“With this change we are also able to increase the brightness of the Summer Ball’s fireworks by 23%, giving you an improved experience, wherever you it is in the middle of Queen’s Lawn you happen to be watching them,” he continued. This issue, as well as the dim projection of images onto the Queen’s Tower were among the Union’s top three issues, identified through its annual survey of members last year.

Speaking to inside sources, Beit Beaver understands that an increase in projection power of at least 2% year-on-year will be implemented across the next three years, using the funds generated by this change.

Some students, however, were evidently unhappy with this new house cider, with one quoting Bear Grylls, commenting “Better drink my own p***.”
