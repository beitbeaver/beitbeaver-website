In statistics released by the Office of National Statistics, the total value of re-sales of tickets for this evening’s Freshers’ Ball at the Union has surpassed the revenue generated by sales of Bud Light in the Union.

Ticket holders and seekers have been using Facebook groups and Messenger chats to facilitate the exchange of purchased tickets for the event, which according to some economics experts, have injected a £350m boost to the economy.

Bud Light has seen disappointing sales since its adoption at the beginning of the new academic year, reaching levels not seen since the release of Panopto and Chill t-shirts last year.
