In dramatic scenes at last night's snowy CSP Wednesday at the Union, members of the Christian Union performed what many described as a "supernatural miracle" as they appeared to transform several kegs of Bud Light into Stella.

At around 10pm, just half an hour after the door charge began, panic ensued among bar staff as supplies of the popular lager, Stella 4, ran out. Managers were forced to suggest Bud Light, a controversial diluted hops-flavoured product, as an alternative, to disgruntled attendees.

James King, a reveller caught up in the chaos, told Beit Beaver reporters, "f*** me, all I wanted was a crisp, refreshing pint of quality Belgian nectar and they tried to give me a pint of piss water."

Quick-thinking attendees then approached the Christian Union's tea and biscuit stand to request their assistance with the Stella problem, and said to the orange-jumpered volunteers, "They have no more Stella." Nearby the CU stand, there were six metal kegs of Bud Light that were used washing the Union minibuses, each holding 50 litres of the substance.

CU volunteers then asked people to take some Bud Light and give it to the duty manager. They did as requested and the duty manager tasted that the Bud Light had turned into Stella. He did not realise, or care, where it had come from, although the people who had brought it to him knew. The duty manager then announced over the PA system in Metric, "The bar staff usually serve the best beer first and then the cheaper stuff, like Bud Light, after attendees have had too much to drink; but today, they have saved the best till now!"
