title: Grammarly turns down CGCU Bolt magazine sponsorship deal
date: '2018-02-26 00:00:00'

The technology company, Grammarly, has walked away from sponsorship talks with the City and Guilds College Union (CGCU) for its popular magazine, *Bolt*.

The deal fell through after assessments by the company, which makes substitutes for education, determined that it would be economically unviable to provide grammar spell-checking services to the publication, meaning that *Bolt*'s publishers are still seeking sponsors.

The editor of the Bolt told the Beit Beaver, "sadly, Grammarly decided ir [sic] was too much effort to proofread a fundametaly [sic] broken publication. We are however looking for sponsors due to a lack of funding, and will literally take anyone whi [sic] will give us money." This news comes amid a series of minor errors in the [latest publication of *Bolt*](https://cgcu.net/bolt.html), which included a gaffe on the front cover indicating that two dozen bread products were open as part of the CGCU's election campaign. The Beit Beaver contacted sources at Imperial College Union to verify the validity of the information, but were told, "as far as we know, the CGCU have not opened up 24 bread rolls, Swiss rolls or rolls of any other description to publicise their election positions."

The mistakes also drew criticism from the committee of the Department of Computing Society, whose name had been  stylised, *Doc-soc*. The society's Marketing Officer told the Beit Beaver, "it's DoCSoc." The Beit Beaver understands that several DoCSoc committee members threatened to create a meme about *Bolt* and subsequently murder the meme.
