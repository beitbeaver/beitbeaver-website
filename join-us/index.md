> “I can write good”

We’re always looking for new writers, whether you just want to submit one article, or you’re looking to get involved more long term. We’re after good-natured banter and satire.

> “I can tech/social media/internet”

We have a Facebook page, a Twitter page and obviously, this website. All these things need maintaining from time to time and any competent hands would be useful. The website is generated using Jekyll.

> “Will this look good on my CV?”

No. If you want something to look good on your CV, we’d advise getting a proper job.

> I’m interested!

Email **editor@beitbeaver.com**, tell us what you want to do and we’ll get back to you.
