**Your semi-trusted source of fake news at Imperial College London.**

Hopefully, you were smart enough to work this out, but in case you go to UCL, or are a lawyer, most of the articles are fake news, so not true, for the time being at least. By "fake news", we don't mean what Donald Trump calls fake news, but like actual fake news.
